            <div class="contents">
                <p>This is a quick note to say that I am currently implementing the changes necessary to allow me to safely
                    re-open my barber shop which must comply with government guidelines. As soon as I am advised on when I
                    can re-open I will notify you. Check my Google business page for subsequent updates. I might have to
                    open by appointment only, depending on Government guidelines. If so there will be an online appointment
                    system or you can phone to make an appointment.
                </p>
              <h4 style="text-decoration:underline;">The necessary changes I am making to the barber shop are as follows:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>ALL HAIR MUST BE WASHED BEFORE VISITING FOR A HAIRCUT to protect the health of customers and staff.
                    </li>
                    <li>There will be no cash till ….. CARD PAYMENTS ONLY PLEASE in line with government guidelines.</li>
                    <li>I am re-designing the shop to allow for SOCIAL DISTANCING ( 2 METRES) while hopefully keeping 2
                        chairs working at once to minimise waiting times. 1 chair with me and 1 chair with Aidan (he has
                        completed his course and is ready and keen to assist you all with your mullets and any other
                        interesting looks that you’ve been rocking!</li>
                    <li>When the shop is fully open you will be asked to queue outside so let’s hope the weather is kind!!!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ok well I’ll get on with sorting the shop and you lot can carry on growing those mullets!!!
                    Until my next update …….Stay Safe………
                    Love to you all!!!
